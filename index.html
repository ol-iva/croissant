<h1>the 6 Best Croissants</h1>
<h3>It’s a common fact that no Parisian breakfast would be complete without a croissant (or two—we’re not judging).</h3>
<p>But despite the abundance of bakeries in the city, not all of them are created equal. And when it comes to pastries in France, you should only settle for the best of the best.

    But no need to worry about wasting your precious euros on a subpar croissant. We’ve done all the hard work and gone on a mission to find the best croissant in Paris. The best part: We’re sharing the results with you.

    Here are six exquisite croissants that you’ll want to devour until the very last crumb.</p>
<h3>1. Maison Pichard</h3>
   <p>A family business for more than 20 years, Maison Pichard (88 Rue Cambronne) is the ideal place to go for a traditional yet memorable croissant. In 2011, owner and baker Frédéric Pichard won an award for best croissant in Paris, and a single bite into his perfectly flaky and airy creation will tell you just why.

       What’s the secret? A perfect marriage of milk flour and creamy Pamplie butter, baked to perfection to give it that crunchy golden exterior. Be sure to drop by Maison Pichard as their buttery beauties will leave you craving more.</p>
<h3>2. Café Pouchkine</h3>
   <p>Take your breakfast or tea break to a whole new level with a croissant from Café Pouchkine. Located on the Place de la Madeleine, this elegant café will charm you with its sophisticated salons, stylish ambiance, and most importantly, its almighty croissant a la vanille.

    Traditional-looking on the outside, the appetizing golden treat is bound to win you over with its subtle but distinct bourbon vanilla filling. Pair it with a scrumptious hot chocolate—you’ll think you’ve died and gone straight to croissant heaven!

       Still not convinced? In addition to their scrumptious pastries, Café Pouchkine is worth a stop for the decor alone. The classic Belle Époque interior will transport you straight to the glory days of Parisian café culture.</p>
<h3>3. Stohrer: Best Almond Croissant in Paris</h3>
    <p> Nestled on the lively rue Montorgueil, Stohrer’s first claim to fame is as the oldest pâtisserie in the city. The legendary establishment was founded in 1730 by King Louis XV’s pastry chef, Nicolas Stohrer, and is known to make the best almond croissant in Paris.

    Wait no more and get in line with the regulars to try this heavenly pastry, lightly dusted with icing sugar and heavy with delicious almond cream. It’s rich and almost cake-like, making it the perfect sweet pick-me-up as you explore the City of Light.

        Keep in mind that it is on the larger and richer side as far as croissants go, so one will likely be plenty for most people.</p>
<h3>4. Laurent Duchêne</h3>
  <p>The MOF, or “Meilleur Ouvrier de France,” is a prestigious title awarded to the best craftsmen in the country. What better place to buy your pastries than from one of the few celebrated winners, Laurent Duchêne?

      Located in the 13th arrondissement, his bakery is worth checking out for the croissants alone. But for a truly decadent treat, try the exquisite croissant au chocolat: tender layers of dough covered in rich chocolate, with a praline filling you won’t soon forget!</p>
<h3>5. Du Pain et des Idées</h3>
   <p>Situated just a few steps from the scenic Canal St Martin, Du Pain et des Idées is just the place you’ll want to visit after skipping stones on the river Seine in true Amélie style.

    Here, the bread and pastries are made with skill and expertise by master boulanger Christophe Vasseur. The acclaimed artisan baker is famous for only using high-quality, organic ingredients, so his croissants are pure butter and pure bliss. Plus, croissants are made continuously all day long, so you’re guaranteed to get a fresh one.

       Located in a breathtaking 19th-century building, Du Pain et des Idées is also famous for their sweet “escargots“: spiral-shaped pastries that come in a variety of tempting flavors. The only downside to visiting this famous bakery is having to choose!</p>
<h3>6. La Maison d’Isabelle: Best Croissant in Paris 2018</h3>
    <p>In the heart of the Latin Quarter, La Maison d’Isabelle specializes in baked goods made with organic French butter and flour. The award-winning croissants are perfectly puffy, deliciously flaky, and a pleasure to indulge in at any time of day.

    Don’t take our word for it though—Maison d’Isabelle took home the 2018 top prize for the best croissant in Paris. If you’re still not convinced, they also boast some of the best baguettes in Paris.

        Fun fact: Despite their recent accolades, La Maison d’Isabelle hasn’t raised the prices of their award-winning baked goods. The legendary croissants are still just €1 each, making it easy for just about anyone to fit into their budget.</p>
